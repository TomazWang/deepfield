## Why This Knowledge Base?

**Primary Goal:** (Choose one or describe)
- [ ] Legacy codebase takeover - need architecture and deployment docs
- [ ] New team onboarding - need glossary and conventions
- [ ] Vendor system integration - need API docs and examples
- [ ] Compliance audit prep - need data flow and security docs
- [ ] Monolith decomposition - need domain boundaries

## Autonomous Learning Configuration

**How this works:**
After bootstrap, the system will run multiple learning cycles autonomously - reading code, connecting concepts, and building documentation. After each cycle, it creates a staging area where you can add feedback or new sources.

**Max Consecutive Runs:** [Configured during setup: 3, 5, 10, or "Until plan complete"]

This controls how many learning cycles run before pausing for your review. The system will:
- Focus on HIGH priority topics first
- Update confidence levels after each run
- Stop when learning plan is complete OR max runs reached
- Create staging areas for you to add feedback between runs

You can always run `/df-continue` to continue learning, or `/df-status` to check progress.
